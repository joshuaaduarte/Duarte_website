            <h2 class="section-heading">Inspiration</h2>

            <p>
                I have always loved the packaging that surrounds every apple product I have owned. 
                Every detail is rigourously thought through as the experience of unboxing the product 
                is like no other. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I recently graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a Master of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering 
                with a concentration in Product Design. I thought this project would be a super cool way to put what I have 
                learned to the test as the packaging surrounding this product has yet to be released yet. I have also challenged myself 
                to complete this project in 7 days. I hope to take you along through my entire process through this document. 
            </p>
          
            <h2 class="section-heading" style="text-align: center;">Day One</h2>
            <p>
                In starting this project, particularly due to the rigourous timeline, it is extremely important to establish 
                some early concepts I want covered and requirements that I will aim to achieve in the seven. 
                In doing so, it will prevent me from going on tangents that stray away from what I am trying to accomplish. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                A well thought solution should have considered the following:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Unboxing experience: How will the user interact with it?
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Critical dimensions and tolerance stacks
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Material choice, associated enviornmental impact and cost impact
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Design for manufacturing: What processes/equipment are required to make and assemble parts?
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Engineering Analysis of Design, including:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Force required to release or extract components from packaging
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Ability of components and packaging to withstand drop and other high impact events
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Key Design Risks
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Package Contents</h2>
            <p>
                The packaging of the Apple vision pro like any other Apple product will not only contain the main product itself, but 
                supporting products that ensure its functionality. For this project, these are the items I suspect will be inside the package:
                <ul>

                    <li>Apple Vision Pro Main Display</li>
                    
                    <li>Apple Vision Pro Headband</li>
                    
                    <li>Battery Pack</li>
                    
                    <li>Headset Tether</li>

                    <li>USB-C Cable</li>

                    <li>USB-C Power Adapter</li>

                    <li>10-Page Documentation Pamphlet</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Day One Goals</h2>

            <p>
                The goal for today is all around research. I wanted to be able to gather as much information pertaining to 
                the Vision Pro as possible. Being the the product has yet to be released, I suspect that obtaining the information 
                will be much more difficult than that of pre-existing Apple products. Nevertheless, I will aim to gather as much as I can. 
                <br>
                Below is a few things that I will be looking at today: 

                <ul>
                    <li>Product Research</li>
                    <ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Vision Pro Research</h2>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">General Information</h2>

            <p>
              The Apple Vision Pro spacial computing headset was announced on June 5th, 2023 during the annual Worldwide Developers 
              Conference. This headset will be available in early 2024. This headset is Apples take on Virtual/Augmented Reality. 

            </p>


            <a href="#!">

            <span class="caption text-muted">
                Apple Vision Pro
            </span>

            <p>
            Apple spent last segment of the day one conversations uncovering the numerous specs the product has. It seems that 
            Apple went all out with making the headset look as luxurious as possible. It definetely was clear that they would be 
            targeting the luxury and early adopter market as the price was $3500. This approach is extremely different from the approach 
            their competitor Meta has taken. It is fitting for Apple as they seem to think that before making something that everyone can 
            afford, they should make something that everyone wants.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Product Specifications</h2>

            <p> 
              As previously mentioned, the Apple Vision Pro has yet to be released, so I am fully reliant on information that Apple 
              has released in their keynote speech, and the experiences of those that have interacted with the headset. I will attempt 
              to provide the information that I obtained and specify if it is speculative or not. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Dimensions and Weight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>General Headset</li>
              From what I was able to gather online, the headset is speculated to have a weight of around 454 grams. For the purpose of 
              this project, this is the weight I will be using. Gathering the details regarding the dimension of the headset proved to be 
              a little challenging. With there being no definitive details about it, I resulted to using the AR file that apple provides on 
              their site discussing the product. From what I gathered, the headset has a height of ~90mm, a width of ~160mm, and a total depth 
              of ~250mm from the front of the housing to the back of the headband. The front glass and aluminum housing is ~40mm, and with the 
              light blocker attached, it is ~90mm. For the properties revolving the components in the headset, I will be relying off of my ability to compare 
              the product to other existing Apple products based off of its appearance and use case as a wearable.
              <li>Front Housing</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Glass Front Panel</li>
                For the front glass panel, I am presuming that the glass has similar properties to that of the Apple watch. In the keynote, 
                it is said to be a laminated glass which may add some more structural integrity. However, for the sake of this project, I will be assuming 
                it has the properties of an Apple watch that I will be using when doing further analysis.
                <li>Aluminum Frame</li>
                The aluminum frame sits behind the laminated glass and serves as a key structural component that houses all of the internal components. With 
                this being a wearable, I suspect that the Apple Engineers who designed this would have aimed to make this as light as possible. For that 
                reason, I am suspecting that this aluminum frame has the same properties as their notable Airpods Max headphones who utilize a aluminum to form 
                the housing of the headset. 
                <li>Headphone and Chargine Band</li>
                The headphone and charging band are connected to to the side of the aluminum frame and feed power and receive audio from the 
                headsets internals. When I first saw these components, I immediately compared them to the existing Apple Watch sports band. This 
                sports band is made of a durable silicone. These are the properties I will be using for the project. 
              </ul>
              <li>Light Blocker</li>
              The light blocker will be one portion along with the headband that will be in constant contact with the user. For that reason, I 
              suspect Apple designed this product with breathability and maleability in mind as it should keep the user fresh during extended use and 
              fit ther user extremely well to prevent light from slipping in. This maleable fit and breathability is something I suspect the Apple 
              Airpods Max cushions have for the best audio experience. 
              <li>Headband</li>
              The headband is the other component that will be in constant contact with the user. This part was described to be designed with breathability 
              and flexibility in mind. From the looks of it, I am comparing it to the trail band of the apple watch which provides sufficient flexibility, 
              durability, and comfort.
              <li>Power & Cables</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Battery</li>
                To power this headset, Apple has landed on a external battery apporach that aimed to reduce the weight the user would be forced 
                to have on top of their head. In doing so, it will allow the user to wear it for longer durations. From what I could gather, the 
                battery has enough power to sustain the headset for 2 hours and is suspected to be ~2,000 mAh. It is also suspected to weigh 
                between 200-300 grams and will be settling for 250 grams for this project. The dimensions of the battery pack are also unclear, 
                but have estimated them to be 65mm x 150mm x 25mm for this project. 
                <li>Power Tether</li>
                The power tether will be used to connect the headset to the external battery pack. It seeems to be made as Apples woven cables which 
                are being seen in as the chargers of recent Apple products. I have estimated its length to be ~ 630mm.
                <li>USB-C Power Adapter</li>
                The USB-C power adapter that I will be using will be the one that comes standard with all new iPads.
                <li>USB-C</li>
                The USB-C power cable will be the one that comes standard with all new iPads which is at a length of 1m.
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">The Apple Way</h2>

            <p>
              I have spent a good portion of my day watchinga ton of unboxing experiences for Apple products. From what I can tell, and 
              the reason for doing this project, they are phenomenal and extremely well thought out. Every detail seemed to be considered.
              Below are the several features that most Apple products have that I will aim to cover.  
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Product Protection</h2>
            <p>
              I have never opened a Apple package to uncover a damaged product. 
              It should be able to withstand potential impacts, shocks, or vibrations that can occur during shipping. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Simplicity</h2>
            <p>
              In the products that Apple have, the products and packaging have an emphasis on 
              simplicity. They are minimalistic, clean, and really easy to understand. The unboxing 
              experience is straightforward without clutter or complicated opening mechanisms. 
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading3">The Shell</h2>

            <p>
              If you have every unboxed an Apple product, you can probably picture the snow white box covered in a sleek plastic wrap or 
              having the little tab on the underside that allows for the top cover to be removed. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Fit and Function</h2>

            <p>
              My favorite part of opening an apple product is the when I remove the lid of the product packaging. It seems that Apple has 
              designed packages such that they remove with a phenomenal feel and audio response that can only be possible with the tolerances that 
              the package has within itself. 
            </p>

            <p>
              These tolerances are present throughout all aspects of the unboxing experience. From that initial cover removal, to the package being lifted 
              from its perfectly designed slot, these tolerances are designed to be extremely precise to create a great feel, but also keep the product 
              in a stable position from the factory to the user. 

            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
              This has been more present in the most recent years as Apple is aiming to be 100% carbon neutral for its supply chain 
              and products by 2030.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that being said, the materials used should be recyclable and aim to reduce excess packaging.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Branding</h2>
            <p>
              If you were to look at a shelf at Best Buy, you can always tell which products belong to Apple. 
              This is due to their profound brand identity. With the package I design, I need to stick to their standards 
              so that it is visually appealing, sleek, and elegant. 
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading2">Competitors</h2>
            <p>
              With this product, Apple has ventured into a market that has been owned by a variety of other companies. The main being 
              Meta and Oculus (who now belongs to Meta).
            </p>

            <p>
              Below is a image of the unboxing of the Meta Quest 2. To get to the stage that is seen, the user removes a sliding cover 
              which then allows the user to open the box. Although this layout of the Meta Quest 2 makes sense, I am not a fan of how 
              cluttered that middle section is. In that section there is a attachment for users with glasses, documentation, and the 
              and other cardstock like components that attach to the headset to keep it secure. 
            </p>

                Meta Quest 2 Unboxing
            </span>

            <p>
              Having seen this unboxing experience, and not being a true fan of its aesthetics, I am pretty sure that I want to orient the front of the 
              headset to the user so that it has a cleaner look to it and is more engaging with the user. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Day One Reflections</h2>

            <p>
              After spending the day researching the Apple Vision Pro, Apple unboxing experiences, and Apple's competitors, I feel that I have a good idea 
              of the approach that I want to take for creating the packaging for the Apple Vision Pro. I am sure that I will be getting a further understanding 
              of the headset and will have to make many more assumptions as I go through the design process to complete this. I am excited to see what I will come up with. 
            </p>
