            <h2 class="section-heading">Inspiration</h2>

            <p>
                I have always loved the packaging that surrounds every apple product I have owned. 
                Every detail is rigourously thought through as the experience of unboxing the product 
                is like no other. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I recently graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a Master of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering 
                with a concentration in Product Design. I thought this project would be a super cool way to put what I have 
                learned to the test as the packaging surrounding this product has yet to be released yet. I have also challenged myself 
                to complete this project in 7 days. I hope to take you along through my entire process through this document. 
            </p>
          
            <h2 class="section-heading" style="text-align: center;">Day One</h2>
            <p>
                In starting this project, particularly due to the rigourous timeline, it is extremely important to establish 
                some early concepts I want covered and requirements that I will aim to achieve in the seven. 
                In doing so, it will prevent me from going on tangents that stray away from what I am trying to accomplish. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                A well thought solution should have considered the following:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Unboxing experience: How will the user interact with it?
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Critical dimensions and tolerance stacks
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Material choice, associated enviornmental impact and cost impact
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Design for manufacturing: What processes/equipment are required to make and assemble parts?
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Engineering Analysis of Design, including:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Force required to release or extract components from packaging
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Ability of components and packaging to withstand drop and other high impact events
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Key Design Risks
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Package Contents</h2>
            <p>
                The packaging of the Apple vision pro like any other Apple product will not only contain the main product itself, but 
                supporting products that ensure its functionality. For this project, these are the items I suspect will be inside the package:
                <ul>

                    <li>Apple Vision Pro Main Display</li>
                    
                    <li>Apple Vision Pro Headband</li>
                    
                    <li>Battery Pack</li>
                    
                    <li>Headset Tether</li>

                    <li>USB-C Cable</li>

                    <li>USB-C Power Adapter</li>

                    <li>10-Page Documentation Pamphlet</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Day One Goals</h2>

            <p>
                The goal for today is all around research. I wanted to be able to gather as much information pertaining to 
                the Vision Pro as possible. Being the the product has yet to be released, I suspect that obtaining the information 
                will be much more difficult than that of pre-existing Apple products. Nevertheless, I will aim to gather as much as I can. 
                <br>
                Below is a few things that I will be looking at today: 

                <ul>
                    <li>Product Research</li>
                    <ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Vision Pro Research</h2>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">General Information</h2>

            <p>
              The Apple Vision Pro spacial computing headset was announced on June 5th, 2023 during the annual Worldwide Developers 
              Conference. This headset will be available in early 2024. This headset is Apples take on Virtual/Augmented Reality. 

            </p>


            <a href="#!">

            <span class="caption text-muted">
                Apple Vision Pro
            </span>

            <p>
            Apple spent last segment of the day one conversations uncovering the numerous specs the product has. It seems that 
            Apple went all out with making the headset look as luxurious as possible. It definetely was clear that they would be 
            targeting the luxury and early adopter market as the price was $3500. This approach is extremely different from the approach 
            their competitor Meta has taken. It is fitting for Apple as they seem to think that before making something that everyone can 
            afford, they should make something that everyone wants.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Product Specifications</h2>

            <p> 
              As previously mentioned, the Apple Vision Pro has yet to be released, so I am fully reliant on information that Apple 
              has released in their keynote speech, and the experiences of those that have interacted with the headset. I will attempt 
              to provide the information that I obtained and specify if it is speculative or not. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Dimensions and Weight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>General Headset</li>
              From what I was able to gather online, the headset is speculated to have a weight of around 454 grams. For the purpose of 
              this project, this is the weight I will be using. Gathering the details regarding the dimension of the headset proved to be 
              a little challenging. With there being no definitive details about it, I resulted to using the AR file that apple provides on 
              their site discussing the product. From what I gathered, the headset has a height of ~90mm, a width of ~160mm, and a total depth 
              of ~250mm from the front of the housing to the back of the headband. The front glass and aluminum housing is ~40mm, and with the 
              light blocker attached, it is ~90mm. For the properties revolving the components in the headset, I will be relying off of my ability to compare 
              the product to other existing Apple products based off of its appearance and use case as a wearable.
              <li>Front Housing</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Glass Front Panel</li>
                For the front glass panel, I am presuming that the glass has similar properties to that of the Apple watch. In the keynote, 
                it is said to be a laminated glass which may add some more structural integrity. However, for the sake of this project, I will be assuming 
                it has the properties of an Apple watch that I will be using when doing further analysis.
                <li>Aluminum Frame</li>
                The aluminum frame sits behind the laminated glass and serves as a key structural component that houses all of the internal components. With 
                this being a wearable, I suspect that the Apple Engineers who designed this would have aimed to make this as light as possible. For that 
                reason, I am suspecting that this aluminum frame has the same properties as their notable Airpods Max headphones who utilize a aluminum to form 
                the housing of the headset. 
                <li>Headphone and Chargine Band</li>
                The headphone and charging band are connected to to the side of the aluminum frame and feed power and receive audio from the 
                headsets internals. When I first saw these components, I immediately compared them to the existing Apple Watch sports band. This 
                sports band is made of a durable silicone. These are the properties I will be using for the project. 
              </ul>
              <li>Light Blocker</li>
              The light blocker will be one portion along with the headband that will be in constant contact with the user. For that reason, I 
              suspect Apple designed this product with breathability and maleability in mind as it should keep the user fresh during extended use and 
              fit ther user extremely well to prevent light from slipping in. This maleable fit and breathability is something I suspect the Apple 
              Airpods Max cushions have for the best audio experience. 
              <li>Headband</li>
              The headband is the other component that will be in constant contact with the user. This part was described to be designed with breathability 
              and flexibility in mind. From the looks of it, I am comparing it to the trail band of the apple watch which provides sufficient flexibility, 
              durability, and comfort.
              <li>Power & Cables</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Battery</li>
                To power this headset, Apple has landed on a external battery apporach that aimed to reduce the weight the user would be forced 
                to have on top of their head. In doing so, it will allow the user to wear it for longer durations. From what I could gather, the 
                battery has enough power to sustain the headset for 2 hours and is suspected to be ~2,000 mAh. It is also suspected to weigh 
                between 200-300 grams and will be settling for 250 grams for this project. The dimensions of the battery pack are also unclear, 
                but have estimated them to be 65mm x 150mm x 25mm for this project. 
                <li>Power Tether</li>
                The power tether will be used to connect the headset to the external battery pack. It seeems to be made as Apples woven cables which 
                are being seen in as the chargers of recent Apple products. I have estimated its length to be ~ 630mm.
                <li>USB-C Power Adapter</li>
                The USB-C power adapter that I will be using will be the one that comes standard with all new iPads.
                <li>USB-C</li>
                The USB-C power cable will be the one that comes standard with all new iPads which is at a length of 1m.
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">The Apple Way</h2>

            <p>
              I have spent a good portion of my day watchinga ton of unboxing experiences for Apple products. From what I can tell, and 
              the reason for doing this project, they are phenomenal and extremely well thought out. Every detail seemed to be considered.
              Below are the several features that most Apple products have that I will aim to cover.  
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Product Protection</h2>
            <p>
              I have never opened a Apple package to uncover a damaged product. 
              It should be able to withstand potential impacts, shocks, or vibrations that can occur during shipping. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Simplicity</h2>
            <p>
              In the products that Apple have, the products and packaging have an emphasis on 
              simplicity. They are minimalistic, clean, and really easy to understand. The unboxing 
              experience is straightforward without clutter or complicated opening mechanisms. 
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading3">The Shell</h2>

            <p>
              If you have every unboxed an Apple product, you can probably picture the snow white box covered in a sleek plastic wrap or 
              having the little tab on the underside that allows for the top cover to be removed. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Fit and Function</h2>

            <p>
              My favorite part of opening an apple product is the when I remove the lid of the product packaging. It seems that Apple has 
              designed packages such that they remove with a phenomenal feel and audio response that can only be possible with the tolerances that 
              the package has within itself. 
            </p>

            <p>
              These tolerances are present throughout all aspects of the unboxing experience. From that initial cover removal, to the package being lifted 
              from its perfectly designed slot, these tolerances are designed to be extremely precise to create a great feel, but also keep the product 
              in a stable position from the factory to the user. 

            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
              This has been more present in the most recent years as Apple is aiming to be 100% carbon neutral for its supply chain 
              and products by 2030.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that being said, the materials used should be recyclable and aim to reduce excess packaging.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Branding</h2>
            <p>
              If you were to look at a shelf at Best Buy, you can always tell which products belong to Apple. 
              This is due to their profound brand identity. With the package I design, I need to stick to their standards 
              so that it is visually appealing, sleek, and elegant. 
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading2">Competitors</h2>
            <p>
              With this product, Apple has ventured into a market that has been owned by a variety of other companies. The main being 
              Meta and Oculus (who now belongs to Meta).
            </p>

            <p>
              Below is a image of the unboxing of the Meta Quest 2. To get to the stage that is seen, the user removes a sliding cover 
              which then allows the user to open the box. Although this layout of the Meta Quest 2 makes sense, I am not a fan of how 
              cluttered that middle section is. In that section there is a attachment for users with glasses, documentation, and the 
              and other cardstock like components that attach to the headset to keep it secure. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Having seen this unboxing experience, and not being a true fan of its aesthetics, I am pretty sure that I want to orient the front of the 
              headset to the user so that it has a cleaner look to it and is more engaging with the user.

              After spending the day researching the Apple Vision Pro, Apple unboxing experiences, and Apple's competitors, I feel that I have a good idea 
              of the approach that I want to take for creating the packaging for the Apple Vision Pro. I am sure that I will be getting a further understanding 
              of the headset. I am excited to see what I will come up with.

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Opening Outer Shell</h2>

            <p>
              The outer shell of this package is one of the most important sections. The reason is that it is the first part that the user 
              sees. It is the segment that initially catches the attention of the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              In brainstorming the various different layouts of how this shell might look like, I took inspiration from various apple products. 
              The main components that I figured that I should capture are the product being highlighted on the top face of the shell, the 
              name of the product being placed on the front and back side, and the apple logo on the right and left side.  
            </p>

            </span>

            <p>
              With this in mind, I went into deciding which view would be most appealing and display the product in a manner I found suitable. 
              After looking at the various arrangements, I landed with the laminated glass being the face of the product as it is on 
              the landing page of the product. However, I thought that it would be nice to show the product with the screen on as 
              most Apple products that have a display have it illuminated on the package face. Unfortunately, I 
              was unable to get an image that I thought would be a good fit. 
            </p>

            <p>
              As for the other faces of the shell, I landed on using a normal black apple logo, along with 'Vision Pro' in the SF Pro font.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Initial Layers</h2>

            <p>
              The opening layer is the first layer that the user sees once that they remove the oh so satisying frictioned outer shell.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this layer, I contemplated what I would want the user to see. The two different methods I landed on was a documentation 
              packet that is included in all Apple products, or the user viewing the product. 
            </p>

            </span>

            <p>
              As I brainstormed, I ended up deciding how I would want the headset revealed to the user. In doing so, I determined that 
              with that orientation, it would be best to have a 'protectant' layer above it to prevent any damage to the laminated glass.
              This resulted in the decision of having the documentation packet placed above the headset and be the first layer of the package. 
            </p>

            </span>

            <p>
              With this selection, I was able to then begin visualize the next layer which would show the headset itself. Ultimatelym, I 
              decided that the headset would be held in a shell that resembled that of the airpods packaging. 
            </p>

            <p>
              This shell holds the product well and provides the user with an area surrounding the proudct for a more seamless removal as 
              they are able to place their fingers there. However, to make this work, I had to establish a pretty key assumption. This 
              assumption is that the audio and charging bands are removable and are expected to be connected by the user as seen with the 
              Apple watch products. This assumption is possible as within the WWDC keynote, there are several frames where the product is 
              displayed without those bands. 
            </p>

            <a href="#!">

            </span>

            <p>
              Aside from assisting in the packaging sense, this assumption also allows apple to easily have boxes with different colored 
              bands to appeal to those with different styles and such. 
            </p>

            <p>
              With this assumption, the product shell was ultimately decided to hold both the main device itself as well as the 
              light blocker. This would allow the light blocker to be easily swapped out at the Apple store if needed as it is suspected 
              that Apple will provide various options for the optimal fit to the user.

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Day Two Reflections</h2>

            <p>
              Today gave me a greater look into the details that Apple packaging holds. I was able to determine what the general 
              design of the outer shell and the first two layers that the user would see would look like. I only have a few concerns 
              in the designs I made. Particularly in the shell that is holding the headset itself. The concern is in how the user 
              would be expected to remove this shell to expose the next layer that I am anticipating will hold the remaining accessories. 
              I will tackle this problem once I have a greater idea of how the accessories could be laid out based on their dimensions.  
            </p>




            <h2 class="section-heading" style="text-align: center;">Day Three</h2>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Day Three Timeline</h2>

            <h2 class="section-heading3">Brainstorming/Concept Development</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Inner Layer Three</li>
              <li>Layer Two & Layer Three Interaction</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Inner Layer Three</h2>

            <p>
              The third layer is what the user will be exposed to when they remove the shell that holds the headset itself. This layer should hold all 
              of the accessories that will allow the headset to function. These accessories include an external battery, the power tether, the headband, the audio/charging bands, 
              a 30W power adapter, and a 1 meter long USB-C cable. 
            </p>

            <p>
              For this layer, I took to viewing how Apple typically packages their accessories. What I found is that they are usually laid out in some 
              symmetrical format that is in line with the users perspective when opening. Each accessory that is also wrapped in some fashion. For example, 
              the wires tend to have a cardstock like paper rap that keeps them neatly wound. Other accessories would be covered in a foggy plastic wrap that 
              was easily removable. For some other accessories like the bands in the apple watch packaging, they would be put within a box packaging that 
              resembled the box that would hold the documentation of the product.   
            </p>

            <a href="#!">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../media/images/projects/visionPro/dayThree/accessoryInspiration.jpg">

            <span class="caption text-muted">
                Accessory Inspiration
            </span>

            <p>
              With that being said, I chose to wrap the wires and power adapter that would be in this layer as they have typically been done in other packages. 
              As for the headband and the audio/charging bands, I chose to package them within a seperate boxes. The reason for the decision is that I suspect 
              Apple selling various headbands and audio/charging bands. Having the seperate boxes would make the swapping of the styles much easier for those that 
              are assembling the packages. Also, having them in their own self contained boxes would allow for the layer to be more aesthetically appealing and designed 
              with symmetry in mind. 
            </p>

            <p>
              With these design decisions made, I was then able to create rough sketches that would allow me to better visualize the layout.
            </p>

            <a href="#!">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../media/images/projects/visionPro/dayThree/accessoryShell.png">

            <span class="caption text-muted">
                Accessory Layout
            </span>

            <p>
              Ultimately I felt most comfortable with the option that is circled. This option ensured that the Apple logo on the battery remained upright, and 
              felt the most symmetrical. This layout also allowed for the best interaction between the second and third layer as the tether would be placed 
              within the light blocker portion of the second layer. The tether cable will have a wrap on it such that it is exposed upon removing the product from 
              the second layer to allow the user to lift the tether and thus the second layer from the package to expose the third layer. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Although I am satisfied with this positioning, I will be making the final decision in the coming days as I beign modeling the package as 
              it will give me a better idea of the dimensions of each product and how they fit within the space I decide. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading2">Day Three Reflections</h2>

            <p>
              With the ideation I was able to complete today with respect to the third layer, I am much less concerned with the issues that may arise with how 
              the user would go about interacting with the package. I am now only concerned with how I could best utilize the space to ensure that it is optimized 
              for minimal waste while still being aesthetically appealing to the user. In the coming days, I will begin modeling the packaging to fit the headset and 
              the accessories while keeping manufacturing and assembling in mind.  
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, I was not able to dedicate too much time to the project today and was only able to refine sketches of what I thought 
              the packaging would look like. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Beginning with the outer shell. The outer shell would be the first part that the user would experience in unboxing the headset. I chose 
              to resemble other apple packagings. This shell did so by having the product at the top face, the apple logos to each side, and the product 
              name in the front and back faces. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The next view of the unboxing experience is the documentation packet. This packet will display 'Designed by Apple in California'. This 
              packet would be able to hold all of the legal and informational content for the product as well as serve as a protection layer for the 
              headset itself.

            <p>
              This third layer is the main layer of the product as it will be the first viewing of the product to the user. I chose to orient the 
              product this way as it is simple as seen in other Apple packages. 
            </p>

            <p>
              This product is embedded within a shell and has a rim surrounding it that is large enough to put fingers around the edge and lift up 
              the headset from it. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The shell that is holding the headset is a vital component to the seperation of the packaging. Ultimately, the decision was made to 
              have the tether cable embedded in the middle where there is space within the light blocker. This adds structural integirty as well as 
              makes it the point in which the user can lift the shell to expose the next layer.

              The accessory shell is what will hold the battery pack, headband, audio/charging bands, 30 W power adapter, and a USB-C cable.
              This shell aims to be simmple by placing the cable and power adapter underneath the packaging of the bands and headband. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Underneath this shell, I aim to design a carboard cut that will act as a structural support for the shell and the above components.

              This day of creating more refined sketches has allowed me to better allow me to visualize how I will begin modeling the system. I 
              am concerned with the dimensioning of the system as I do not have truly defined definitions with the headset being unreleased. As I obtain a 
              model of the actual headset and its various components, these sketches will help me tremendously to aligns the systems.
