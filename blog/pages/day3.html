            Another productive day. I accomplished what I set out to do, but found myself needing more time
            than expected on a few things. One thing in particular was the code I had planned on writing for the motors
            within Gambit. The code was just not cooperating with me today, but I did make progress nonetheless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I kept to a more strict schedule that made me use my time more efficiently. Efficiently in the sense
            that if I set 15 minutes for a specific task at the beginning of the day, I would do all that I could to
            finish the task in that allocated time. The only task that surpassed my allocated time was you guessed it.
            Code for the motors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, it was a very good day as I made good use of my time throughout it. Tomorrow, I will try to work
            on other personal projects aside from Gambit to see what could come of it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
          <p>
            The motors today were causing me trouble. Yesterday, I mentioned I wanted to create a script that allowed me
            to enter a direction and a set number of rotations that would then make the motors spin accordingly.
            Although
            I was able to do so, it would only work once before the script would malfunction. More specifically, the
            serial
            monitor input for the arduino would have a false reading which would make the motor not behave as expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            I spent many hours trying different approaches and debugging, but came to a point where I got tired of
            looking
            at the the arduiono IDE. So as I normally do, I distracted myself by FaceTiming some friends. One friend
            that
            I called up was Jonathan. A coding legend that I always look to for any advice pertaining to computer
            science or
            anything really now that I think of it. We had a conversation regarding a project he recently started that
            incorporated hand gesture recognition with a DC motor.
          </p>

          </span>

          <p>
            Prior to our conversation, I had no idea that I could get a python script to communicate with an arduino.
            This possibility made my mind wander as I knew I could now incorporate a greater chess engine to the
            chessboard which would in turn make it a better product. Hopefully, I can learn how to do so within the
            coming weeks. It should be pretty interesting.
          </p>


          <h2 class="section-heading">SHPE</h2>
          <p>
            I was able to get the ball rolling on some of my remaining SHPE tasks today. From finishing up the RLDC
            document to
            working on the NCP Report. Within the report, I began adding comments to every section that I saw. These
            comments
            mentioned new information and metrics that have been obtained over the course of the semester that I knew
            should
            be included in the report. Within the next few days, I plan to continue adding more comments and have other
            officers
            add some as well. I want to do my best to have a rough draft of the document completed a week from today.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Meditation</h2>
          <p>
            Meditation has always been something that I have strived to turn into a daily habit. The idea of spending a
            few minutes a day to quiet the mind has always been good for me.
            Yet, I find myself not making the time for it. Well, today I did. I spent 10 minutes or so breathing in and
            out and working diligently to prevent any other thought from
            breaching my focus. It was difficult to do so, and even more difficult to restrain myself from looking at
            the clock to see how close the timer was to 0. I know it will become
            easier the more I do it and I know it will bring me a sense of calmness as I go about my days.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reading</h2>
          <p>
            I made it to page 52 today of my book covering essentials of physics from the scope of Richard Feynman. In
            the pages that I read, concepts were covered pertaining to
            quantum physics. A lot of the material went over my head, but it was very interesting to say the least. One
            topic that stuck with me was the idea that laws are based off
            of the idea that if an experiment was conducted, it could be replicated time and time again. However,
            quantum physics reveals that things can never truly be replicated. Things
            vary greatly on the subatomic level to a point where change is innevitable. Pretty interesting topic if you
            ask me.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also made it to the next chapter in the book that is beginning to demonstrate the relation of physics to
            other sciences. Should be a fairly simple concept to grasp in comparison
            to quantum physics, but who knows, I might be in for a surprise.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I journaled, worked out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal
            projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful for individuals who answer questions on coding forums. I would be lost without you.
          </p>
