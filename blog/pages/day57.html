          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>

          <p>
            The majority of the day was spent fixing an issue that I new would arise whenever the time came to install the 
            sensing matrix within the acrylic of the board. However, I failed to see how bad it would be.
          </p>

          <p>
            The majority of the sensing matrix did not fit within the acrylic. The first two columns seemed to be fine, but 
            as one progressed further into the far side of the matrix, the wires and hall effect sensors did not seem to be 
            anywhere near where they were supposed to be. They would be about .25 inches to .5 inches off of their mark. This 
            may not seem like much, but when you're dealing with a board that is about 18 inches across, the errors should be 
            far less significant. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Where the wires and sensors did not line up, I had to unsolder and resolder accordingly. Once again, I was inhaling 
            far too much solder fumes than I would have liked. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Luckily, I had painters tape at my disposal to hold down sensors and wires in place as I would fix other areas throughout 
            the board. It truly saved me an immense amount of time. 
          </p>

            Wiring
          </span>

          <p>
            Once that issue was resolved I was able to somewhat permanently able to fix the matrix within the board with some hot glue. 
            I know this may not have been the best approach, but for now, it will do as I continue refining the board.  
          </p>

          <p>
            With the wires in place, I added the acrylic to the board and it truly was a phenomenal feeling seeing everything together. 
            I even added the last panel to the side to get a even better look to the board. In doing so, I stuffed the breadboard and arduino inside 
            which surely will not work long term, but it was cool to see everything enclosed.

          <p>
            Tomorrow is the last day that I have access to the FEDC so I will be adding a few touches to the sensing wiring, and 
            will try to run a few tests before I have to bring everything back over to my place. 
          </p>

          <p>
            With these portions of the board near completion, I began printing a few chess pieces that will be used for the board. Understand 
            that these pieces have to be altered in a way that they will be able to house a magnet that is responsible for its movement within 
            the board. I printed these pieces using my resin printer as it allows for greater detail and strength than what the PLA printer I own 
            could provide.

          <p>
            I began looking into new designs for the main page of my personal website. I am tired of the bright colors that make mine up 
            and want to transition to a more minimal and elegant page. I created a FIGMA account to start brainstorming and am curious to 
            see what will come of it in the next few days.

          <p>
            Today, I journaled, did not work out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal
            projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful Myra, the SHPE advisor I had the pleasure to work with this past year. She was instrumental to our success, and 
            will continue being so throughout the next few generations of the organization. With her as an advisor, I know any team team 
            will be in good hands.
