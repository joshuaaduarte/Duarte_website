          <p>
            Having a good sleeping schedule is something I only have when my bad sleeping schedule happens to sync with
            the normal hours in a
            day. The reason it is so bad is because I am a huge advocate of naps. These naps have been the death of my
            productivity over this
            journey. Today, my nap took up a larger part of my day that I wish I could have dedicated to some of the
            projects I have been doing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am going to try to stop taking naps. Atleast naps that span any more than 30 minutes. This would not only
            give me more time throughout the day
            to work on things, but do more in the sense of making sure that I fall asleep earlier and align more with a
            good sleeping schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even with the nap that took up a chunk of my afternoon, I had yet another good day. From finally getting
            python to communicate with my arduino, to
            finishing up my sketch of the camera slider and starting on the model. Tomorrow will be the first day I try
            implementing this nap policy, so let's
            see what can get accomplished.
          </p>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Camera Slider</h2>

          <p>
            In finalizing the camera slide sketch, I was able to narrow in on the parts that needed to be designed for
            and the parts that I would simply use from
            what I have laying around. Ultimately, the system comprises of 3 motors. Motor one is responsible for
            'sliding' the camera. Motor two rotates the camera
            about its mount. Lastly, motor three will control the tilt of the camera.
          </p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">
            Camera Glider Sketch
          </span>

          <p>
            The system does not seem too complex, I just need to settle on dimensions that will hold the camera and
            motors across the system. With this sketch
            complete, I went ahead and modeled the base board that uses dimensions of a piece of scrap wood I have
            laying around and the stepper that I plan on
            using. Thankfully, I was able to find a model of the camera that I imported into the system for dimension
            and assembly purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tomorrow, I will complete the sketch and start modeling some of the known parts like the base board, stepper
            motors, and rods I am going to use. There's no way
            I am going to model the camera as it would take me far longer than I would like, so I hope to find a model
            online somewhere that I could use.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">3D Printing</h2>
          <p>
            The phone holder finished printing. It took about 9 and a half hours that was accompanied by a high pitched
            sound that kept me awake throughout the night.
            Although it was pretty easy to print and required little post-processing, I did learn a few things. I should
            have orietned the print better so that it
            would not require as much supports to create. Doing so would have saved me the fear of breaking it as I was
            removing the interior supports. It also would
            have drastically decreased the printing time and costs.
          </p>

            Phone Holder
          </span>

          <p>
            With the phone holder complete, I went ahead and quickly modeled something that would go on to solve a minor
            problem I have been dealing with. Whenever I
            need my Ipad, I always forget where I previously left it or whenever I don't need it, it is taking up a
            large amount of space on one of my desks. To resolve
            this, I quickly created some c bracket mounts that I would go on to place under my desk to comfortably hold
            my ipad and the cases I have for it. Lets hope
            it doesn't fall in the middle of the night.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Python Arduino Communication</h2>
          <p>
            I was finally able to get a python script able to communicate with an arduino. It was actually a lot easier
            than I thought it would be.
            It simply writes and reads information to the serial monitor on the Arduino. What I actually had more
            trouble with was my limit switches
            cooperating with me. Ultimately, it was a simple fix in altering a while loop in the arduino script, but it
            was not simple in getting there.
            Nevertheless, I am glad I was able to get python working on the arduino. I am excited to what posibilities
            await this.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I journaled, worked out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal
            projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful for my parents. They have done nothing but support and love me throughout all of my ventures.
