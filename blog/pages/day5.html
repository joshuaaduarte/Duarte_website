            I was exhausted today. I had a sleepless night that was filled with taking care of some work. I thought that
            if I happened to stay awake for the entire day, my sleeping schedule just might get back on track. Aside
            from
            that, it was a great day. I was able to meet up with Elizabeth, Karen, Vincent, and Evelyn. Karen, Vincent,
            and Evelyn started working on their projects! I am so excited for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I continued working on Gambit by incorporating the limit switches within the programming. Once I completed
            that,
            I tried to begin working on my other projects that I had lined up. Specifically those that involve the use
            of
            python. But as I said. I tried. My coding environment was not coorperating with me, and hopefully it can get
            resolved sooner than later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tomorrow should be more loose, and hopefully productive. Only time will tell.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike yesterday, Gambit did not cause me any issues. The work I completed today pertained to getting limit
            switches
            incoorporated within the program responsible for moving the stepper motors that I have been using. Limit
            switches are
            buttons. Buttons that are typically placed at extremities of systems that uses a coordinate system. The
            limit switches allow
            for the program to understand where the edges of coordinate system are. For Gambit, these limit switches are
            used to understand
            where the origin is.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a little work, the motors still perform as they do yesterday in which they respond to my input of the
            direction and rotation. However,
            after performing this action, the motors turn left until the first designated limit switch is pressed which
            would indicate that the
            electromagnet is as far left as designed. It then moves the motors in the upward direction until the second
            limit switch is pressed. This
            would indicate that the electromagnet is at a designated origin. From here, it then awaits its next
            commands. Which is pretty cool.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next subsystem I plan on working on is that of sensing. Currently, the chessboard uses reed switches.
            Reed switches activate when
            they interact with a magnetic field. This is useful as the chess pieces that are moved using an
            electromagnet already have a magnet in them.
            This magnet within the chess pieces are used to activate the reed switches which can then be interpretted by
            the designed program. Below you can
            see the orientation of a set of reed switches that are placed throughout each of the 64 squares of the
            chessboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tomorrow, I plan on testing another sensing mechanism that is typically used with magnets. This sensing
            mechanism is a hall effect sensor. Can't wait to tell you
            about it.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Personal Project 'Internship'</h2>
          <p>
            Vincent, Evelyn, and Karen made it out today. They came to start some work. And that they did. As mentioned
            in the beginning days with Kevin, I am wanting to
            give some guidance to a few students in hopes of having them learn a few things over the course of the
            summer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today they began the design phase of their projects and I am excited to see how it will turn out. Karen is
            working on a personal
            habit tracker. This will allow for the user to have their habits stare them down if they do not complete
            them. However, if they
            do complete it, they will be greeted by a nice green light and hopefully a great dopamine response.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vincent is working on a split flap display. You know. The thing that spells words with a really satisfying
            click as half of the letters rotate
            about a spindle. It's pretty cool. I passed this project on to him because a friend, Eddie, thought it was
            cool and wanted to do it himself, but would need
            some help on it eventually. I thought this was a challenge that Vincent could have some fun with. We'll see
            soon enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            Evelyn is working on a project that she brought up to me earlier this semester. As people are still social
            distancing, she wanted to create a product that
            could be placed at the center of tables within the engineering complex to show if one is open to people
            sitting with them or not. A very interesting product
            could come of this, and hopefully she learns a few things from it along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            I feel like I am being harsh on them at times as I critiqued their designs, but I know its for the better.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I journaled, worked out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal
            projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful for the technology I have available to me. It gives me the opportunity to be curious and seek
            new challenges daily.
          </p>
