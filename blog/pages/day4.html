            It was a really nice Sunday. I gave my self some time to do a reset for the week ahead. This will be the
            first week in which I will be blogging daily and working to make the most of each day. Aside from the
            reset, I continued working on the code responsible for making the motors within Gambit function. After
            banging my head against the desk for a few hours I ultimately got it to work. For now.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also got to thinking about the many projects I want to complete over the next 60 days. I'll probably share
            them with
            you all in the coming days, so be ready. I already know the list will grow as time passes, but that's a
            problem for another day. Nevertheless, I am
            scared I will not be able to accomplish as much as I want to over this endeavor after dealing with
            the Gambit problem over the last day and a half. I am sure it's a learning curve thing, but only time
            will tell. I just have to keep at it, and don't beat myself up too much over the problems I am sure
            to face as embark on this journey of learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another good day in the books. Excited for what tomorrow has in store.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
          <p>
            A '\n' and an equal sign. A '\n' and an equal sign. A '\n' and an equal sign is what has caused me to spend
            many many hours of my day
            looking at code that would not work.
          </p>

          <p>
            So looking at what I was trying to accomplish again. I set out to create a script that allowed me to enter
            a direction (up, down, left, right), and a number coorelating to the amount of rotations the motor should
            turn.
            With this input, the script would then turn the input into respective moves made by the motor. Depending on
            the
            direction, motor one, two, or both would turn clockwise or counter-clockwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            My script seemed to be working fine as I would typically ask it to turn left and provide 20 rotations.
            However, on the
            second time, no matter what direction I asked it to go, if I asked it to turn 20 rotations, the motors would
            not react.
            Also, it would always make the motors turn counter clockwise. Something that should only happen when I type
            'left'.
            In regards to the first problem, I came to find out that the motors stored the position throughout the
            script and was absolute and not relative. What I
            mean by this is that like my good friend Jonathan put it, if you ask a football player to go to the 20 yard
            line, and then
            ask it again, it will not move. However, if it was relative, you would just ask the football to move 20
            yards each turn and ultimately, the
            football player would reach the destination you actually want them to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was able to resolve this reltatively easily by just setting the position of the motor to 0 after
            each iteration. The \n problem was a different story. As mentioned, prior to inputting the revolutions, I
            needed to input
            a direction. As I also mentioned, I would always start by entering left into the serial monitor. Always.
            What I came to find out was that the reason the motors would always turn counter clockwise was because it
            was
            the first if statement I had within the script. Within this if statement, I used a singular equal sign
            instead of two. This
            single equal sign would always have its condition met as long as I entered something to the serial monitor
            making the motors
            turn counter-clockwise. Always making them turn counter-clockwise. I then added the second equal sign which
            still did not
            resolve my issue. Now no condition was being met across the four directions I had in place. It wasn't until
            I entered a '\n'
            at the end the directions within the condition of the if statements that it worked flawlessly. A '\n'
            typically notes the creation
            of a new line, or hitting enter on the keyboard. Which is something I had to do each time I input something
            within the serial monitor.
            This '\n' and equal sign caused me much pain over the hours that I looked over the code. But boy when I say
            there was no greater feeling to
            seeing the motors turn as I had intended, I mean it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">SHPE</h2>
          <p>
            With the help of the co-chair for RLDC, Brenda, the metrics pertaining to the conference were provided and
            input within the document that I need
            to provide our recommenders with. I have it scheduled to be sent out tomorrow morning, and I truly hope they
            find the metrics impressive, because what
            that team was able to accomplish was a conference worth remembering.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Eats</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever tried air fried 'boiled' eggs? Well you should. Heat some up at 270 degrees farenheit for
            about 15 minutes and
            you will have yourself a nice treat. Definetely going to be using this more often than you know. Might have
            to watch my cholesterol though...

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I journaled, stretched (quite intensely), read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one
            of my personal projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful for that special someone who I am honored to have spent the last nine months with. Thank you
            for putting up with me.
