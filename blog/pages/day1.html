            This is what I hope to be the first of many posts. 60 to be exact. Why 60? Well there
            is 60 days between today, May 26th, and July 25th. July 25th is my last day of summer.
            After this date I will be moving out of my apartment here in College Station and begin
            my move to California where I plan to obtain my Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at U.C.
            Berkeley.

          </p>
          <p>
            The last three summers I have been blessed with opportunities to intern with Northrop
            Grumman, ExxonMobil, and Boeing. Although I gained valuable experience, I never made the
            time to focus on personal interests. Whether it was personal project, physical health,
            building healthy habits, and financial awareness, I always pushed the idea of working
            on these things as I felt that I did not have the time.

          </p>

          <p>
            This summer is different. I did not make the effort to obtain an internship to focus on what
            matters to me and what can set me up for a successful and eventful future. I no longer have the
            excuse of "I don't have the time". I have nothing but time. Well 60 days worth of time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am eager to see what can happen if you set time to work on things that are important to you.
            These blogs will serve as a way to keep myself accountable to doing something each day. No matter
            how small, I want to ensure I at least document something. This will allow me to view the progress made
            on any of the endeavors I take on.
          </p>

          <p>
            With each blog, I hope to highlight different aspects of my day. This would include any of the projects I
            worked on,
            any lessons learned, successes, failures, along with tracking the habits I am building. These areas will be
            noted with a header as seen below. This being the first blog of the 60 days, it is quite a lengthy one.
          </p>

          <p>
            If anyone is reading this, I am always open to any comments, feedback, suggestions, or anything really as I
            embark
            on this 60 day journey.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">SHPE</h2>
          <p>
            Today, like most days this last year, was mostly dedicated to SHPE, or the Society of Hispanic Professional
            Engineers. I have
            had the privilege of serving as the President of my chapter at Texas A&M University this past academic year.
            Talking about that
            is a story for another day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Twice every year, each chapter is responsible for delivering a report that highlights the successes and
            failures the
            chapter has witnessed over the course of the year. As President, I am responsible for the creation of this
            document.
            The report is due on June 15th. However, before creating this report, it is tradition that a document be
            created that
            that highlights events of the organization that have occured during the past semester. This document is then
            sent out to
            individuals that will serve as recommenders of the chapter to SHPE National. This semester, we have the
            privilege of having the
            Dean of Engineering, and one of advisors being recommenders.
          </p>

          <p>
            My time today with respect to SHPE was spent finalizing a portion of the Spring Semester Event Highlight
            document to
            send it over to our recommenders so they can begin working on the letter of recommendation. I also began
            working on the
            report as well. It is going to be a busy couple of weeks with SHPE to say the least.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
          <p>
            This is the first of many personal projects that I will be talking about. However, it is the only one I
            worked on today, so
            you will just have to wait to hear about the rest. Gambit is the attempt to make a fully functional
            automated chessboard.
            What this entails is that you, a single entity, can play physical chess without having another person
            present.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project was thought up as the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic started. Many people
            during this time picked up new hobbies like running, sewing, or learning a new instrument. I picked up
            chess. The game facinated me
            and began taking up a huge amount of my free time. I would play online, with my roommates, or anyone who was
            up for it. However, as you
            can imagine during a pandemic, playing on a physical board with others became increasingly difficult. I was
            forced to solely play virtually, but
            with my academic courses being virtual, scrolling endlessly on my phone, and only being able to see others
            through a screen, I got tired of playing
            online chess quicker than you could say checkmate.
          </p>

          <p>
            This led to the idea of creating a automated chessboard. I didn't think it would be too hard. Just connect a
            few motors to an electromagnet, find a way
            to tell the pieces apart and run it through a chess engine, and you should be good to go. Boy was I wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although it would be a challenging project, I would not have to go at it alone. During the summer of 2021, I
            had the idea of submitting this project as
            a proposal to be my senior design project. Thankfully, the proposal was accepted and during the course of my
            senior year, I was paired with 4 other
            mechanical engineers to bring this project to fruition.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this project now being my senior design project, I had to scrap all of the ideas and efforts I have
            made to ensure that the team had a say in what the
            final product would be like. We then went through the entire design process and came up with something that
            was fairly similar to my initial concept and design.
            Throughout the course of this past semester, the team turned concepts into reality by creating a functional
            prototype. This prototype went on to impress countless individuals
            during the senior design showcase. Although it was 'functional', there was still a lot of room for
            improvement.
          </p>

          </span>
          <p>
            Thankfully, university faculty has sponsored me to continue working on the project for another year where it
            will then be returned and displayed for prospective students, curious
            minds, and faculty alike. During this year, not only will I strive to create a refined product, but another
            board alike that will allow me to continue working on it after the year is
            complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect that I am currently trying to improve are the electronics behind the movement subsystem of the
            chessboard. Currently, the board is operated using two NEMA 17 stepper motors.
            These stepper motors are then connected to subpar drivers. Today, I worked on connecting two motors to a new
            set of drivers that are more adequate for what I am trying to accomplish. The
            A4988 drivers are able to withstand greater currents and operate at lower temperatures than those that were
            previously used. The image below shows the quick circuit I made to work two motors.

          <p>
            Although it seems to be a fairly simple circuit, I am not an electrical engineer, so things can be a bit
            harder than they seem at times, and if I learn things, I learn them the hard way. The hard lesson
            I learned today was that of capacitors. They are not like resistors and must be placed in a specific
            orientation. If not, they will explode. As I personally witnessed. With the capacitor placed correctly,
            the motors worked smoothly. Tomorrow, I plan to make the motors work simulataneously to be able to move the
            gantry as needed in the chessboard.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Personal Project 'Internship'</h2>
          <p>
            During the summer proceeding my freshman year, I was blessed with the opportunity to be an intern for
            Northrop Grumman. This changed my life for the better. Seriously, this opportunity opened so many doors and
            gave me insights that I use to this day. With that in mind, I have taken the opportunity to mentor a few
            individuals who were unable to obtain an internship for the summer. I plan to take these students through
            a rigourous curriculum of desing, problem-solving, and prototyping.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today marked the start of the program for one of my 'students', Kevin. Although I will not be able to work
            with him as closely as I would like due to to him taking an opportunity that has been provided to him by the
            university,
            I hope to make the most of the time we do have together. For Kevin, I thought I would get him started with a
            simple design project to get him acquanted with the design process. I asked him to create for me a phone
            stand. One that
            would allow me to prop my phone on my desk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beginning this project, I instructed him to create five seperate sketches with different views, and two of
            the designs must be comprised of atleast two parts. Once he completed this, I had him pitch these ideas and
            select one that
            he thought met some pre-established requirements and that he liked. He then went on to select dimensions
            that worked for the phone I have. He collected the dimensions using a pair of calipers. I made sure to give
            him my pair of
            manual calipers so he would be grateful to use the digital calipers later down the line. Tomorrow, he will
            continue working on this project by finalizing his sketch and input his design in solidworks where I hope he
            becomes familiar
            with the software itself. I have asked him to create all the parts of his design, create an assembly, and
            drawings for each part as well. One discussion I hope to have with him in the coming days is that of
            tolerances. He will be
            creating the phone holder itself using a SLA 3D printer which is sure to come with some issues. I can't
            wait!
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Web Development</h2>
          <p>
            Aside from the other things going on with my day, I did plenty of web development. For instance, this blog
            needed to be created somehow. Using my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I was able to create this page that
            I know will
            change substantially by the end of the 60 days. It was challenging at first as it has been a while since I
            worked on a website, but it had to get done. Over the next few days, I will be working to refine my personal
            website to be
            more in tune with my current stage in life.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Another way I plan to use this blog is to track some of the habits I am wanting to build. Today, I
            journaled, worked out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal projects.
            Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>
          <p>
            I am thankful for my family, friends, and significant other who have impacted me greatly in helping me get
            to where I am today.
