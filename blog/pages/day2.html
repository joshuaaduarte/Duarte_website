            To rest or not to rest? That is the question.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know what you're thinking. What do you mean rest? It's day two of your sixty day blog journey.
            That's the equivalent of failing your new years resolution on January 2nd. Well, I don't plan on stopping
            just yet. The question of resting came to me as I progressed throughout my very productive day. I worked on
            everything I had set out for the day and completed the tasks in much less time than I had set aside for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although I did not just check everything off my to do list and enjoy some Netflix, I did find myself behind
            my phone
            screen. What can I say, social media has always found a way to make me mindlessly scroll throughout my days.
            I need to find a way to
            limit that. I hate to say it, but I think I just might have to delete Tik Tok.
          </p>

          <p>
            This summer is dedicated to making the most of my time. Whether it be with my personal projects or spending
            time with friends and family, I want to
            ensure I made the most of it. To do that, I have limit my phone usage, and find a way to stay busy for the
            majority of the day. I have
            to become really good at becoming comfortable being uncomfortable. As soon as I start feeling comfortable in
            my day to day, I know
            I am not challenging myself to reach greater limits. One thing that may help me in continuously challenging
            myself would be to
            maintain a better schedule. I currently use Google calendar to track my daily tasks and schedule.
            I will strive to stick to the schedule, and update it more frequently throughout the day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aside from all of the phone scrolling, I did a lot. I was able to continue working on web development, work
            on Gambit, work on
            some cinematography, and knock out some chores.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I spent the day continuing to work on the motors. More specifically, I needed to find a way to make
            the motors turn simulataneously. The
            chessboard uses a H-Bridge gantry system to make the electromagnet move horizontally and vertically
            underneath the board. The H-Bridghe uses the rotational
            speed and direction to make the electromagnet move is specific directions. Below there is a better
            visualization of the what I mean about the movement.
          </p>
          <a href="#!">

          <span class="caption text-muted">
            Programmed motors moving simulataneously
          </span>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I was able to get two motors turning simulataneously. Or what atleast looked simulataneous. The
            code that I was writing in was C within arduino. This language
            operates line by line, so the a line of code can not run until the line before it is complete. This creates
            an issue when needing to operate two things at the same time.
            To combat this, the script that was written, makes the stepper motor turn one step at a time where then the
            other motor is instructed to turn one step as well. This is repeated
            until the motors have completed a set amount of steps. This process happens EXTREMELY quickly. It is quick
            enough that you are unable to tell that the motors are running one after
            another.
          </p>

          </span>

          <p>
            Now that the motors run 'simulataneously', I am now working on making the motors complete a set number of
            rotations on command. This will allow me to
            easily program the motors later down the road to fit my needs with respect to moving the electromagnet
            within the H-Bridge.

          <h2 class="section-heading">SHPE</h2>
          <p>
            I was not as busy with SHPE as it should have been. I spent my day completing a document that pertained to
            the Regional Leadership Development Conference that
            our chapter hosted this past semester. I am awaiting metrics that can then be documented and distributed to
            our recommenders as well as used within our report. Tomorrow
            I plan to complete this document, distribute the information to our recommenders, and work on the report
            that is due on June 15th.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Reading</h2>
          <p>
            This is a new section that I hope to include within most of my blogs. Here, I hope to summarize what I read
            from day to day. Unfortunately, I am not a ridiculously fast
            reader so don't expect me to do full book summaries. Maybe chapter summaries if that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Todays reading and the reading I expect me covering over the next week or so is that of Richard P. Feynman.
            A physicist before my time that left his mark. The book, Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of
            Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher, is just that. I am currently on page 35 and my eyes have
            been opened as the book covers essentials of physics that were previously hard to grasp.
            This book is based off the lectures completed by Richard Feynman during some of his years at CalTech. These
            lectures broke down extraordinary topics to levels in which a fifth grader could understand.
            This act of breaking a complex topic down to a level that is easily understandable is a testament of true
            understanding. As I go about this summer, I plan to continuously learn. In doing so,
            I will make the greatest of efforts to turn the topics I know into something that can be easily understood.
          </p>

          <p>
            As far as what I have read goes, the pages have began covering physics from a fundamental approach. I have
            learned more about atoms in motion, and I am currently reading a section that is going into
            greater depths of Quantum physics. Whatever that means.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Eats</h2>
          <p>
            My grocery stash is nearing its end. For the first time in a while mind you. What can I say? I like to eat
            out.
            Nevertheless, today was filled with me cooking the remainders of my groceries and preparing it for the days
            to come.
            I air fried some lemon pepper chicken, made some overnight oats (surprisingly now one of my favorite things-
            sorry for
            ever doubting you Abraham if you are reading this), and made a delicious smoothie. 2 Bananas, some grade A
            HEB 2% milk, a splash
            of vanilla, and a hefty amount of ice and boom. A smoothie that brought me back to my childhood and will
            hopefully cure my
            workout pains for the week.

          <p>
            I have always thought it would be cool to be a vlogger of some sorts. But, yet again, I never have gone
            through with it. Today, I
            took one step in that direction. I took my drone out to capture the sunset and see what type of views I
            could get of my backyard. Aggieland
            that is.

            Although I do not see myself pushing that publish button on YouTube just yet, I am goint to start recording
            more of my days and capturing some moments
            that I wouldn't mind reliving. Who knows what I'll capture.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Personal Project 'Internship'</h2>
          <p>
            Kevin did not stop by today. Not because of him, but because of my terrible sleeping schedule. Nevertheless,
            through some convincing, he continued working
            on his project. He began putting is idea and sketch into Solidworks. He had some trouble making the base of
            the stand, and struggled on an issue that
            could have been easily resolved has he just asked. I am going to try to be a better mentor to where he may
            feel more comfortable asking for help. After all,
            that's what I'm here for.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Habit Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I journaled, worked out, read, tracked my caloric intake, and worked on at least one of my personal
            projects. Today was a good day.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What I am thankful for</h2>

            I am thankful for everyone that has been so supportive of starting this venture.
