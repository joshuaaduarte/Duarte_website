              This is what I hope to be the first of many posts. 60 to be exact. Why 60? Well there
              is 60 days between today, May 26th, and July 25th. July 25th is my last day of summer. 
              After this date I will be moving out of my apartment here in College Station and begin 
              my move to California where I plan to obtain my Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at U.C. 
              Berkeley. 

            </p>
            <p>
              The last three summers I have been blessed with opportunities to intern with Northrop 
              Grumman, ExxonMobil, and Boeing. Although I gained valuable experience, I never made the 
              time to focus on personal interests. Whether it was personal project, physical health, 
              building healthy habits, and financial awareness. I always pushed the idea of working
              on these things as I felt that I did not have the time. 

            </p>

            <p>
              This summer is different. I did not make the effort to obtain an internship to focus on what 
              matters to me and what can set me up for a successful and eventful future. I no longer have the
              excuse of "I don't have the time". I have nothing but time. Well 60 days worth of time.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am eager to see what can happen if you set time to work on things that are important to you. 
              These blogs will serve as a way to keep myself accountable to doing something each day. No matter
              how small, I want to ensure I atleast document something. This will allow me to view the progress made
              on any of the endeavors I take on. 
            </p>

            <p>
              With each blog, I hope to highlight different aspects of my day. This would include any of the projects I worked on, 
              any lessons learned, successes, failures, along with tracking the habits I am building. These areas will be 
              noted with a header as seen below. This being the first blog of the 60 days, it is quite a lengthy one.          
            </p>

            <p>
              If anyone is reading this, I am always open to any comments, feedback, suggestions, or anything really as I embark 
              on this 60 day journey.

            <h2 class="section-heading">SHPE</h2>
            <p>
              Today, like most days this last year, was mostly dedicated to SHPE, or the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. I have 
              had the privilege of serving as the President of my chapter at Texas A&M University this past academic year. Talking about that 
              is a story for another day. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Twice every year, each chapter is responsible for delivering a report that highlights the successes and failures the 
              chapter has witnessed over the course of the year. As President, I am responsible for the creation of this document. 
              The report is due on June 15th. However, before creating this report, it is tradition that a document be created that
              that highlights events of the organization that have occured during the past semester. This document is then sent out to 
              individuals that will serve as recommenders of the chapter to SHPE National. This semester, we have the privilege of having the 
              Dean of Engineering, and one of advisors being recommenders. 
            </p>

            <p>
              My time today with respect to SHPE was spent finalizing a portion of the Spring Semester Event Highlight document to
              send it over to our recommenders so they can begin working on the letter of recommendation. I also began working on the
              report as well. It is going to be a busy couple of weeks with SHPE to say the least. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Gambit</h2>
            <p>
              This is the first of many personal projects that I will be talking about. However, it is the only one I worked on today, so 
              you will just have to wait to hear about the rest. Gambit is the attempt to make a fully functional automated chessboard. 
              What this entails is that you, a single entity, can play physical chess without having another person present. 
            </p>

            <p>
              This project was thought up as the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic started. Many people 
              during this time picked up new hobbies like running, sewing, or learning a new instrument. I picked up chess. The game facinated me 
              and began taking up a huge amount of my free time. I would play online, with my roommates, or anyone who was up for it. However, as you 
              can imagine during a pandemic, playing on a physical board with others became increasingly difficult. I was forced to solely play virtually, but 
              with my academic courses being virtual, scrolling endlessly on my phone, and only being able to see others through a screen, I got tired of playing 
              online chess quicker than you could say checkmate. 
            </p>

            <p>
              This led to the idea of creating a automated chessboard. I didn't think it would be too hard. Just connect a few motors to an electromagnet, find a way 
              to tell the pieces apart and run it through a chess engine, and you should be good to go. Boy was I wrong. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Although it would be a challenging project, I would not have to go at it alone. During the summer of 2021, I had the idea of submitting this project as 
              a proposal to be my senior design project. Thankfully, the proposal was accepted and during the course of my senior year, I was paired with 4 other 
              mechanical engineers to bring this project to fruition. 
            </p>

            <p> 
              With this project now being my senior design project, I had to scrap all of the ideas and efforts I have made to ensure that the team had a say in what the 
              final product would be like. We then went through the entire design process and came up with something that was fairly similar to my initial concept and design. 
              Throughout the course of this past semester, the team turned concepts into reality by creating a functional prototype. This prototype went on to impress countless individuals 
              during the senior design showcase. Although it was 'functional', there was still a lot of room for improvement. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Thankfully, university faculty has sponsored me to continue working on the project for another year where it will then be returned and displayed for prospective students, curious 
              minds, and faculty alike. During this year, not only will I strive to create a refined product, but another board alike that will allow me to continue working on it after the year is 
              complete.
